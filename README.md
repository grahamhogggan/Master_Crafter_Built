# Master_Crafter
built version of the game I'm working on.
Overview
This is a survival crafting game I've been building with unity. 
In this repository is the windows build files for the game.
The primary purpose of this repository is as a central location for the most recent stable build,
in order to begin any playtesting/performance testing. 
It is NOT The final game in any way. (The art in these builds is nonexistent).
    
General gameplay overview:
The goal right not is to reach the highest score before you eventually die. 
meteors will slowly degrade the world as you play. 
Craft weapons to survive the night, and build factories to extract the maximum resources. 

Controls:
WASD to move, tab to enter inventory.
left click to attack/mine, 
right click to place a block.
scroll/number keys to switch held item. 

e to interact with objects

in inventory:

click on the plus icon next to a recipe to automatically craft it. 
click on the image of an item in the inventory to pick it up. 
you can click on another item slot to switch those items, or drag it to the crafting grid. 

If you have places items in the crafting grid manually:
you can press e to craft them or shift+e to craft and then auto-refill the grid with the same items.
